let story = `Once upon a time there was a brave explorer called ${character}.
He was exploring the depths of a ${setting} when he stumbled
upon a group of ${animals[0]}, ${animals[1]}, and  ${animals[2]}.

John was not afraid and he continued on his journey, defying danger at every turn.
He discovered ancient temples and mystical creatures. He made friends with the locals
and explored every corner of this magical place.

He eventually found himself in a clearing with a large lake at the center.
As he looked out across the lake, he saw a large stone structure in the distance.
He decided to investigate further and he soon realized that it was the entrance
to an underground cavern.

John traveled further into the depths of the cave, following a winding path
until he reached a large chamber. Inside he found a beautiful marble statue
of a dragon. As John looked upon the statue, he realized that this was no ordinary
dragon: it was a powerful guardian of the cave.

John slowly approached the statue and bowed his head in respect. He could feel
the immense power emanating from the dragon. Suddenly, a voice filled the chamber
that said "You have come here to seek my power, brave explorer. I will grant you one wish
but you must answer one question. What would you choose as your prize?"

John thought carefully before answering, "I choose knowledge, that I may gain wisdom
and understanding, so I can protect the people that I love."

The dragon smiled and said "Very well. I grant you the knowledge you seek."
Suddenly, John felt a wave of understanding wash over him and he realized that he
had gained the power to manipulate the elements. He thanked the dragon and quickly
left the cave, eager to use his new power to help those that he cared for.

John returned to his home and was surprised to find that his village was in ruins.
He quickly set to work using his newfound abilities to restore the village to its
former glory. Soon, the village was even better than it was before.

John was celebrated as a hero and people from across the land came to admire him and
hear his tale. He used his newfound knowledge to protect his people and lead them
toward a brighter future.

And so, with a brave explorer and a powerful dragon, a new story began.
